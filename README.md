### ðŸ‘‹ About me
Hi there I'm Sharon, a dedicated professional deeply embedded in the intricate domains of finance, accounting, and Business Intelligence (BI) analytics within the NHS, currently situated in the vibrant city of Manchester in the Northwest. My expertise spans across acute providers, CSUs, and NHS consultancy, where I've committed myself to unraveling the complexities of numbers and data.  I am a mathematics graduate from the University of Bristol. I currently work for the NHS Transformation Unit leading BI analytics projects and also supporting a range of finance projects, take a look at our [GitHub page](https://github.com/NHS-Transformation-Unit).

With a robust background in financial analysis and a keen eye for detail, I thrive on dissecting data to uncover insights and crafting strategies that drive transformation, growth, and efficiency in healthcare settings. 

In the analytics spectrum, I possess a profound understanding of various public health and healthcare datasets, employing a diverse toolkit including R, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI to develop comprehensive deliverables that foster actionable insights.

In the realm of finance, I am skilled in writing business cases and qualified in better business cases, supporting cost improvement programs with precision and expertise.

My journey in the worlds of finance and analytics is underscored by a fervent passion for continuous learning and exploration. I find solace in the depths of reading and self-learning, with each new piece of knowledge fueling my quest for mastery and broadening my understanding of the intricate dynamics within the healthcare sector.

Beyond the realms of numbers and data, I draw inspiration from the harmonies of music. Whether it's the soothing melodies of classical compositions or the rhythmic beats of jazz, music serves as a wellspring of rejuvenation and creativity in my life. It's where I find balance amidst the analytical rigor of my professional endeavors, nurturing both my mind and soul.
